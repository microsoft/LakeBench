class TPCH(_LoadAndQuery):
    """
    Class for running the TPC-H benchmark.

    This class provides functionality for running the TPC-H benchmark, including loading data,
    executing queries, and performing power tests. Supported engines are listed in the
    `self.BENCHMARK_IMPL_REGISTRY` constant.

    Parameters
    ----------
    engine : object
        The engine to use for executing the benchmark.
    scenario_name : str
        The name of the benchmark scenario.
    query_list : list of str, optional
        List of queries to execute. Use '*' for all queries. If not specified, all queries will be run.
    input_parquet_folder_uri : str, optional
        Path to the input parquet files. Must be the root directory containing a folder named after
        each table in TABLE_REGISTRY.
    result_table_uri : str, optional
        Table URI where results will be saved. Must be specified if `save_results` is True.
    save_results : bool
        Whether to save the benchmark results. Results can also be accessed via the `self.results`
        attribute after running the benchmark.

    Methods
    -------
    run(mode='power_test')
        Runs the benchmark in the specified mode.
    _run_load_test()
        Loads the data for the benchmark.
    _run_query_test()
        Executes the queries for the benchmark.
    _run_power_test()
        Runs TPC-H query stream 0.
